What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created in the directory at which we want to create a repository.
The .git directory stores the previous history of the repository that
we have initialized and created.
If we want to create a new repository that is used to manage that repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a stage at which git start to track records of the files that what changes have been made on that files.
We can add files to the staging area so that git can track of what 
changes have been made to which file logically.
It offers the flexibility to see only the particular files where the
changes has been made and we commit that change after that we have 
made the changes in our repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Using staging area we can make sure that what changes we have made with
respect to the working directory and the repository code and make sure 
that we have one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when you want to create a different version of your project and you are not sure of whether it will work or not 
in the future and you have to made some changes in the current projects to made that work.For example when you want to support
different languages and doesn't want to make changes in your original project at that situation branch comes handy.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Using Branch Structure of the git commit we get a visual view of the commit are saved and we know about the concept of rechability.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
Merging two branches that we can combine the two branch or two states add it to your main branch and create a commit to make it your master 
branch. To specify more, you can say it is used to add changes of the branch to the main code in such a way that it not break the whole 
project.
To get a visual view of the branch and get a view of it's conceptual depths.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Pros:Git Automatic merging helps when we want to merge files and they are entirely independent to each other.It done alot of complicated work for us and we don't have to take care of all the casualties along
the way.
Cons: We might have some areas where we have different version of code at same place.For Example, we have a function which is modified by two contributers and we might want to add the which is best for that moment.
Hence, at this time where the doing it manually is the right way and we don't want it go for automatic merging as it leads to ambiguity and even break the working of the code.
